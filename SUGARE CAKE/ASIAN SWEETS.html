Mooncake is a Chinese delicacy that is typically consumed during the Mid-Autumn
festival. This sweet, or sometimes savory, cake is eaten whilst gazing at the moon
during this festival, which is held on the fifteenth day of the eighth month,
following the Chinese lunar calendar.</p>

<p id="para1" class="italic"><img src="mooncake.jpg" alt="cotton " style="width:450px;height:320px;" >
The sweet dough, made from golden syrup, lye water, vegetable oil, and plain
flour, is filled with a lotus paste.
As these cakes have become more commercialized, various other fillings are used,
such as red beans, fruit, and chocolate, which can be found all over the world.</p></div>
