<h1>French sweets </h1>



<p id="par1"> <i>There are many French confectionery names, as France is known for its wonderful and very appetizing desserts,<br>
 French cuisine has a creative sense and taste. It is considered to be a stand-alone kitchen, especially French<br> 
 desserts, which have a different taste and flavour and are very special. Because of this, these desserts have<br>
 been able to invade all the kitchens in all countries and are served either in restaurants or prepared by their <br>
 family's housewives!</i>

<ul class="a">
<li><b>Opera Cake</b></li>
</ul>

<ul class="b">
  <li> <i>is a French cake. It is made with layers of almond sponge cake (known as Joconde in French) soaked in coffee syrup, <br>layered with ganache and coffee (or Grand Marnier) French buttercream, and covered in a chocolate glaze. Its namesake<br>
  originates from the layers resembling the levels of an opera house</i>.</li>
  <li><i>According to Larousse Gastronomique, "Opéra gâteau is an elaborate almond sponge cake with a coffee and chocolate filling and icing."<br>
  Traditionally, the word Opera is also written on top of the chocolate glaze. Edible gold leaf is sometimes added to the presentation</i>.</li>

  <div class="desc">How to prepare <br>Beat the whites until foamy, then gradually add the regular sugar until the meringue becomes sticky.
In a separate bowl, beat the almonds, eggs and powdered sugar at medium speed until foamy.
Add the flour to mix, then combine with a spoon the butter and the meringue-almond mixture, and stir gently.
We stir the mixture quietly from bottom to top, then divide the mixture into the moulds.
Bake for 5 minutes, then transfer the cake to a work surface equipped with parchment paper, and remove the old paper.
Prepare the coffee layer by mixing vanilla, sugar and regular water over medium heat until it boils.
Boil the mixture until it reaches 255F, then separately whisk the eggs until creamy.
Whisk the hot syrup with the eggs, then dissolve the espresso with boiling water and add it to the mixture.
Beat at medium speed, tend to high, then gradually add butter until the mixture becomes creamy and cohesive.</div>

<li><b> Kouign Amann</b>  </li>
</ul>
<ul class="d">
<li><i> is a sweet Breton cake, made with laminated dough. It is a round multi-layered cake, originally made with bread dough (nowadays sometimes viennoiserie dough),<br> 
containing layers of butter and incorporated sugar, similar in fashion to puff pastry, albeit with fewer layers. The cake is slowly baked until the sugar<br>
 caramelizes and the recipe's butter (in fact the steam of the 20 percent water in the butter) expands the dough, resulting in its layered structure. A smaller version,<br>
 “kouignette”, is similar to a muffin-shaped, caramelized croissant.</i></li>
<li><i>Bake the dough slowly, at low temperature, to form many layers, and the sugar builds up in a crispy crust that cracks pleasantly between your teeth  </i> </li>

  <div class="desc">How to prepare <br>Prepare the dough: Combine the water, sugar and yeast in a large bowl. Let rest until foamy, about 5 minutes.
Add 2 cups flour, 1 tablespoon melted butter, and salt to yeast mixture. Stir with a wooden spoon until a very wet sticky dough forms.Dust work surface 
with remaining 1/2 cup flour. Turn dough out onto the floured surface. Knead, folding in excess flour as needed, until dough is soft, slightly sticky, and elastic.
 Place into a greased bowl, cover, and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 1/2 hours.Make seasoned sugar: Mix together sugar and most of the 
 sea salt in a bowl. Taste and add remaining salt if desired.Transfer dough onto a floured surface and press into a rough rectangle. Roll dough into a rectangle about
 1/8- to 1/4-inch thick. Grate 1 stick ice-cold butter over dough, leaving a 1-inch border. Flatten butter using lightly floured hands. Fold rectangle widthwise into thirds.
 Press gently to square out the edges, then place onto a silicone-lined baking sheet. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for 30 minutes.Roll dough into a large rectangle again,
 pulling and stretching the corners as needed. Grate remaining stick ice-cold butter over the surface. Pat down with floured fingers and fold into thirds. Roll back out into
 a rectangle and fold into thirds.
 Repeat rolling and folding one more time. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. </div>

<li><b>Croissant</b></li>
</ul>
<ul class="f">
<li><i>is a buttery, flaky, French viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of the Austrian kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened laminated dough.<br>
 Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape, the dough is layered with butter,rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled into<br>
 a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.</i></li>
<li><i> Plain croissant consists of vegetable oil, usually looks straight, but butter croissant varies in taste it is better </i></li>

 <div class="desc">How to prepare <br>Dissolve the yeast with warm water and 1 teaspoon of sugar in a small dish, and set aside until it is desperate. 
 Dissolve two tablespoons of sugar in warm milk in a small dish. Place the flour in a deep bowl, add the yeast mix, milk and oil, mix the ingredients together well,
 kneading until a smooth and smooth paste is formed. Place the dough in an oversized dish, cover the dish, and set it aside in a warm place for about three hours until it brews and 
 doubles in size. Knead the dough with the hands again, set aside for an additional three hours, to brew and double the size again. Stir the dough and dough again. Straighten the 
 butter to become flexible and soft, but without completely melting and turning into oil, forming it rectangularly. Straighten the paste in the form of a medium-sized rectangle, 
 place the butter on two thirds of the area of the dough rectangle, leaving its limbs without putting the butter on top of it. Roll the non-buttered portion over the middle third 
 of the paste, roll the third third third over it, and roll it out. Sprinkle a little flour on the croissant, put it in a plastic bag, put the bag in the fridge, and leave it for
 about two hours. Remove the dough from the refrigerator, turn it over some and roll it back, then return it to the refrigerator and leave it for two more hours. Take the dough out
 of the fridge, roll it back, divide it, then shape it croissantly. Beat the egg with a tablespoon of water in a small bowl. Grease the surface of the croissant with an egg shake.
 Heat the oven to two hundred and forty-five degrees Celsius. Bake the croissants in the preheated oven for twelve to fifteen minutes. Take the croissants 
 out of the oven, arrange them in a dish suitable for serving, and serve warm.</div>

<li> <i> is a French pastry made of two choux pastry cases, one larger than the other, filled with crème pâtissière, most commonly chocolate or mocha.<br>
 Each case is covered in a ganache of the same flavor as the filling, and then joined decorated with piped buttercream frosting.</i>  </li>

 <div class="desc">How to prepare <br>Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7. Line a baking tray with baking parchment and draw onto it eight circles 5cm/2in wide and another eight 
 circles 2.5cm/1in wide. Put the butter in a heavy-based saucepan with 150ml/5fl oz of water and heat over a medium heat until the butter melts. Bring the mixture to the boil and then immediately remove from the heat.
Quickly tip in the flour. Stir vigorously with a wooden spoon until the mixture forms a soft ball. Return to the heat and cook over a low heat for 3-5 minutes, stirring constantly.
Remove from the heat and leave to cool slightly. Gradually add the eggs, beating well between each addition to form a smooth, shiny paste. Spoon the mixture into a piping bag 
fitted with a 1.5cm/ ½in plain nozzle.
Pipe round discs onto the baking tray in the marked circles and, using a damp finger, smooth over the top of each disc. Bake in the centre of the oven for 10 minutes. Reduce 
the oven temperature to 190C/375F/Gas 5 and cook for a further 10-15 minutes. Remove the choux buns from the oven and pierce each bun with a skewer to allow the steam to escape. Return to the oven for 4-5 minutes to dry out. Remove from the oven and leave to cool on a wire rack.
For the crème pâtissière filling, pour the milk and vanilla seeds into a heavy-based pan and bring gradually to the boil. Remove from the heat and leave to cool for 30 seconds.
 Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and caster sugar until pale, then whisk in the cornflour and plain flour. Pour the vanilla-infused milk onto the eggs, whisking continuously, then pour back into the pan.
Bring back to the boil, whisking continuously over a medium heat and cook for one minute. Pour the crème pâtissière into a bowl. Cover the surface with cling film to prevent a 
skin from forming and leave to cool. Transfer to the fridge to chill.
For the chocolate ganache icing, bring the cream to the boil in a small pan. Remove from the heat. Add the chocolate and stir until melted and shiny. Transfer to a bowl and leave 
to cool. Transfer the fridge to chill until the ganache has thickened to a spreadable consistency.
To assemble the religieuse, spoon the cold crème pâtissière into a piping bag fitted with a long thin nozzle (or alternatively you can use a jam syringe). Fill the choux buns with
 the crème pâtissière.
Dip the filled buns into the chocolate ganache to coat half-way up the sides. Sit the small buns on top of the larger buns.
For the collars, whip the cream in a mixing bowl until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed from the bowl. Spoon the cream into a piping bag fitted with a small star nozzle.
 Pipe lines of cream around the join where the small bun sits on top of the large bun to form a collar.</div>
